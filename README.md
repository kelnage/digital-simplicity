# Digital Simplicity

A simple and elegant watchface for round Garmin devices. Only currently supports round watches that have a screen resolution of 240x240px.

Digital Simplicity is available on [Garmin's Connect IQ store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/97b91745-9287-421d-aa8a-abb437e08eea).

## The watch-face doesn't work!

If you encounter any issues whilst using this watch-face, I definitely want hear about them - but I need a little help from you. If you can follow [these instructions from Garmin](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/how-to-test/#handlingcrashes) to obtain your CIQ_LOG.YAML file, and include that along with the device you have and any configuration settings you were using at the time (top and bottom bar, 12/24 hour watch style, etc.), it will help me fix any lingering bugs that might occur from time to time.
