## Things TODO

- [X] Add options for top and bottom labels (HR, distance), and appropriate suffixes
- [X] Increase clock size
- [X] Add a (blinking?) colon between hours and minutes
- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Internationalisation?
- [ ] Release to CIQ
- [ ] Make notification count bold?
